Today we "finalized" making our dictionary(Trie), and added it to the wrapper in progam.cs.
We also found that in Scrabble.fs the "let move = RegEx.parseMove input" should be replaced by a function 
that returns a move, in order to play the game "automatically". 
For now we have not added anything to the state.
